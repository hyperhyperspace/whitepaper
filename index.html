				<p>When we access a website, the choice of which service provider we are using does not matter. Thanks
				to the networking protocols that underpin the Internet, every service provider gives us access to the entire
				network, creating a universal solution for <i>connectivity</i>.</p>
				
				<p>The Hyper Hyper Space protocol stack proposes a similar universal solution for <i>information 
				systems</i>. While these systems work as peer-to-peer applications, a fully in-browser JavaScript implementation of
				Hyper Hyper Space (using IndexedDB for persistence and WebRTC as browser-to-browser transport) is available, thus
			    making them as easily accessible as any other website.</p>

				<p>The mainstream information systems we access through the Internet (for social networking, 
				communications, workspace collaboration, e-commerce, etc.) work as information silos. The
				network interoperability makes them universally accessible, but that property does not extend
				to the <i>information</i> within, which is locked for access, interaction and modification only in 
				the platform where it was created.
				</p>

				<p>One proposed solution to this problem is replacing each a system by a <i>federation</i> of
				interoperable systems, from which participants can choose. The Hyper Hyper Space protocols propose
				instead a fully decentralized alternative, inspired by the design of the Internet itself.</p>

				<p>The universal connectivity provided by the Internet works by defining a very simple network
				model, that can be implemented over virtually any networking technology: optimistic delivery
				of small packets of information. Each connected application then implements additional protocols,
				like TCP and UPD , to gain additional network guarantees according to their own needs: ordering, 
				reliability, flow control, congestion prevention, etc. An important property of this design, known
				as the <i>end-to-end principle</i>, is that network operators are only bound to implement the 
				simple packet-switching model, while application designers are free, up to a point, to create 
				higher-level protocols that run on the devices that connect to the network. This feature played
				a crucial role in the development and adoption of the Internet.

				<p>The Hyper Hyper Space, following the same pattern, defines a simple <i>information representation</i>
				model, using <b>immutable append-only merkle-DAGs</b>. This is a generalization of the model used successfully
				by blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, but instead of storing financial transactions, each node in the graph
				may contain an arbitrary JSON-like object. Objects may reference each other by using their cryptographic
				hashes, like blocks do in a blockchain. Merkle-DAGs are easy to verify and synchronize between
				devices, while also offering a versatile representation to application-level protocol designers. Gossip and
				synchronization protocols, running over a mesh network overlay, can be customized by applications both 
				to restrict access to the resulting DAG and to enforce application-specific validation rules. The resulting
				optimistic replication of application-defined DAGs fullfills a similar unifying role to the one packet-switching 
				had in the design of the Internet.</p>

				<p>Since the DAGs used by different applications don't need to be disjoint, this model enables new forms of 
				interoperability. The support chat in a company's e-commerce store could be included inside
				the workspace collaboration system -if both were based on Hyper Hyper Space- not by using an API but by actually 
				working on the same data strctures encoded over the DAG. New forms of content linking could be imagined, involving not
				just unidirectional links but richer interrelations over shared information. Instead of URLs and anchors inside
				a document, the entire internal structure of an entity as it is represented on the DAG can be referenced from 
				the outside. The cryptographic hash function used for referencing objects guarantees that this can be done without 
				unwanted collisions.
				</p>

				<h4>Information as merkle-DAGs</h4>

				<p>There is a significant mismatch between writing to an append-only immutable DAG and the mutable
				data structures an application designer may expect. The Hyper Hyper Space offers a data modelling library,
				currently available for TypeScript and JavaScript environments, and a hash-based key-value store. Datatypes
				created using the library can be automatically translated into operations over the immutable DAG and saved
				to the store. Once saved, they can be syncrhonized automatically over the mesh network. A memory
				backend for transient uses, one backed by IndexedDB for web browsers, and a SQLite-based version for use
				in NodeJs are included. 
				</p>

				<p>Storable objects can be constructed using literals (strings, numbers, arrays, dictionaries, etc.) and references to 
					other objects in the store. These references, however, will also use hashes to identify their targets.</p>
	
					<p>In the following example, an object of type <span class="monospace">Message</span> references another of type 
					<span class="monospace">Identity</span> through its <span class="monospace">author</span> field, using its hash value <span class="monospace light warm green">fa34d0&mldr;</span>:</p>
	
					<img class="padding-top padding-bottom" src="img/hello_mom.png">
					
					<p>It is easy to see that this representation only works for immutable objects. If Ken changed his name to Kenny, the
					hash of the <span class="monospace">Identity</span> object would change. All existing references, including the one in the 
					<span class="monospace">Message</span> object above, would still point to the original version!

				<p>On the Internet, IP addresses are the network-independent identifiers that enable universal connectivity.
				Similarly, Hyper Hyper Space introduces an application-independent representation for information objects: <i>Spaces</i>.
				A space may contain a chat room, a discussion forum, an e-commerce store, a blog, etc.
				</p>

				<p>Spaces are universally accessible using <span style="border-bottom: 1px dotted" title="If the system gains popularity, we may need 4-word codes!">3-word codes</span>.
				When ownership and access restrictions are necessary, Spaces use Hyper Hyper Space native cryptographic identities, that can be exported from one application to another,
				to authenticate peers.
				</p>
				
				<p>As an example, here is a <a href="https://hyperhyper.space/chat-window" target="_blank">demo chat system</a> based on Hyper Hyper Space. Each
				chat room is a space, and has its own 3-word code. The page is static, and the contents of each chat room are synchronized between participants 
				browser-to-browser. If you copy the page and host it elsewhere (or locally on your own computer), everthing would work exactly the same.
				</p>

				<p>Websites may be used to look up spaces like in the example above. Spaces can also be <b>embedded using iFrames</b>, and a website may
				also pin down and load a fixed space, providing an experience similar to a <b>regular page</b>.
